My thesis project from school where i made a Custom Footer as an extension in SharePoint Framework,
Im using MS Graph to get last unread mail from the logged in users mailbox and displaying that data in the footer, 
functions to mark mail as read and delete mail is also implemented using MS Graph api calls,
(beware that the delete function really DELETES the current mail and not moves it to outlooks deleted folder)
